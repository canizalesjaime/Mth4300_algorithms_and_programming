## Syntax
* Comments in C++ can be specified in two ways with operator ```// comments for one line``` or<br> ```/* comment can span multiple lines */```  
* Semicolons are used to end a line(instruction) in C++. 
* variables in C++ is how the developer can store and manage data of different forms.There are many variable types:
  * int - Represents an integer ```int x = 7;```(the variable types short and long are also integers, but they represent a smaller and larger range respectively).
  *  float - Represents a decimal number, such as ```float y = 2.718;``` (the variable type double is also a decimal number, but allows for higher precision(more decimal places) at the cost of more memory)
  * char - Represents one character ```char a = 'd';```
  * string - Represents a sequence of characters ```string word = "Hello World";```
  * boolean - A variable that can be either true or false. ```bool check = true;```
* A preprocessor directive is specified using the ```#```. For example #include\<iostream\>, and #include\<string\>. Preprocessor directives are parts of your code that must be prepared before compilation. For example, the compiler must fetch the code for the iostream and string libraries first, before it can compile these sections.
