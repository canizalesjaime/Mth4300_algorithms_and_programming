## Check Python in Docker!
You can open docker and run ```python3 main.py```(from this directory) and run your first python program in docker!

## Operators
Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values.
### Arithmetic Operators
The arithmetic operators work exactly as they do in regular math. They take values as inputs(must be integer or decimal) and return the result of the arithmetic operation.
* \+ adds values
* \- subtracts values
* / divides
* \* multipies
* % is referred to as the mod operator. This opeartor divides the first value by the second then returns the remainder. Example: ```cout<<15%2;``` would print 1. Inputs must be integers to use this operator.
to include logical(boolean), arithmetic(ints and floats), string
* = assigns a value to a variable

### Logical Operators
Logical Operators are used to test if some condition is true or false. They take in two values as input, and return either true or false.  
* ! The not operartor. This is the only operator on the list that takes in only one input value. Returns the negation of the input value.
* && The and operator. Returns true if both inputs are true, otherwise returns false. 
* || The or operator. Returns true if at least one of the inputs is true, otherwise returns false.
* == The equality operator. Returns true if the two inputs are equivalent, otherwise return false.


### Object Operators
C++ is an oject oriented class. What this means is that the software developer has the power to create his own classes(which are treated as types internally). C++ allows us to overload the operators for these classes, which means give semantic meaning to something like **class toaster + class bread**. This statement does not make sense unless we apply meaning to the + operator by overloading it. More on operator overloading in the future!<br><br>

One example is the string class + operator. The + operator for strings is going to concatenate the two strings. For example: ``````

## Conditional Statements
if (else if, else if, ...,else if) else


## Loops
for(pow function) and while(conversion to binary)


## In class assignments for practice
