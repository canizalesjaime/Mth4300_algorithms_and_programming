## Big O Notaion
Big O Notation is a mathematical notation used in computer science to describe the time complexity (how fast:the number of steps the algorithm takes to complete) or space complexity (how much memory:the number of additional memory cells the algorithm needs to complete) an algorithm uses as the input size grows. It focuses on the worst-case scenario, helping to estimate how the performance of an algorithm scales with larger inputs.


### Big O Notation Simplification

**Big O notation** describes the upper bound of the time or space complexity of an algorithm, showing how its performance scales as the input size increases. To simplify Big O expressions, follow these key principles:

### Simplification Rules:

1. **Ignore constants**: 
   - Constants don’t matter in Big O because we're only concerned with how the algorithm grows as the input size grows. 
   - Examples:
     - $O(2n)$ simplifies to $O(n)$.
     - $O(100n + 5)$ simplifies to $O(n)$.

2. **Drop non-dominant terms**: 
   - When an algorithm has multiple terms, keep only the term that grows the fastest as $n$ increases. 
   - Examples:
     - $O(n^2 + n)$ simplifies to $O(n^2)$ because $n^2$ grows faster than $n$ as $n$ increases.
     - $O(n^3 + n^2 + n)$ simplifies to $O(n^3)$.

3. **Focus on worst-case behavior**: 
   - Big O notation typically represents the worst-case scenario of an algorithm, i.e., the most time or space it will use as input grows.

### Common Big O Complexities (in increasing order of growth):

- $O(1)$ – Constant time
- $O(\log n)$ – Logarithmic time
- $O(n)$ – Linear time
- $O(n \log n)$ – Linearithmic time
- $O(n^2)$ – Quadratic time
- $O(2^n)$ – Exponential time
- $O(n!)$ – Factorial time

As the input size $n$ grows, the dominant term becomes the most significant. That's why lower-order terms and constants are ignored.

### Summary:
Big O notation abstracts away constants and lower-order terms to focus on growth trends.
It helps compare algorithms and predict how they will scale as inputs increase.

## Selection Sort

### Steps for Selection Sort:
* Start with the first element: Assume that the first element of the unsorted portion is the largest.
* Compare with the rest of the elements: Compare this element with every other element in the unsorted portion. If any element is larger, update the largest element's position.
* Swap: After finding the largest element in the unsorted portion, swap it with the last element of the unsorted portion.
* Move to the next element: Repeat the process for the next element (excluding the already sorted part at the end).
* Repeat until the entire array is sorted.

### C++ Implementation of Selection Sort (Finding Maximum Element)
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void selectionSort(int arr[], int n)
{
    for (int i = n-1; i >= 0; i--)
    {
        // Find the maximum element in the unsorted portion
        int maxIndex = i;
        for (int j =0; j <= i; j++)
        {
            if (arr[j] > arr[maxIndex]) 
                maxIndex = j;  // Update maxIndex if a smaller element is found           
        }
        // Swap the found maximum element with the first element of the unsorted portion
        swap(arr[maxIndex], arr[i]);
    }
}

void printArray(int arr[], int n) 
{
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    cout << endl;
}


int main() 
{
    int arr[] = {64, 25, 12, 22, 11};
    int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);

    cout << "Original array: ";
    printArray(arr, n);

    selectionSort(arr, n);

    cout << "Sorted array: ";
    printArray(arr, n);

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. Outer Loop ```for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--)```:
   * Each iteration places the maximum element in the unsorted portion at the correct position at the end of the array.

2. Inner Loop ```for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++)```:
   * This loop looks for the maximum element in the unsorted portion (from 0 to i).
   * It updates maxIndex whenever it finds an element larger than the current maximum.

3. Swapping:
* The largest element found in the unsorted portion is swapped with the last element of that portion ```arr[i]```.


#### Example Output:
```c
Original array: 64 25 12 22 11 
Sorted array: 11 12 22 25 64
```

### Time Complexity:
* Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n²) where n is the number of elements in the array.
* Space Complexity: O(1), as no extra memory is used except for temporary variables.
