## Solutions to in class assignments
1. Use stl list and solve the problem from last time for reversing a linked list [solution](./class_assignment_solutions/answers.cpp)
2. What is the time complexity (big O notation) for reversed linked list? [solution](./class_assignment_solutions/answers.cpp)
3. Read the link list from the file and store it in a stl list. Insert three nodes with the values 1,2 and 3 into the stl list. Sort the list by referencing stl list documentation, then write the sorted list with the inserted values into a new file and name it modified_link_list.txt. Reference the documentation and note the runtime and spacetime complexity for insert and sort. [solution](./class_assignment_solutions/answers.cpp)
